**Jip** (most commonly known as **JipStats**, formerly **JipIsPlaying**, **Jip Plays**, and **StatsComparisons**), is a statistics YouTuber who makes high quality subscriber count visualizations. At his peak, he uploaded daily, but now he only uploads weekly to improve video quality and take a break.

# Partnership

Jip partened with **Graphify** in August 2022, which later made him start to make high quality streams.

# BLACKPINK Effect

<br />

Jip started a stream about [BLACKPINK](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/BLACKPINK)'s song 'Pink Venom'. The stream later began to blow up, and Jip hit 1K, 2K, and 3K relatively quickly.
